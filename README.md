# kitt
KITT is a videogame coding practice initially intended for me to learn good OOP practices as well as SOLID principles. Developed in C++ using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org).

It is in very early stages so there is nothing playable so far. Please, bare with me.

## Requirements

KITT is being developed between a MAC and a Windows PC. For MAC I use the latest version of Xcode, and for PC, Visual Studio 2017. It should also work on linux provided you can setup the environment propperly.

To compile the source code, the following components are required:

- **[SDL 2.0](http://libsdl.org)**: Simple Directmedia Layer. It is a library that handle's 2D graphics, Joystick input and more.
- **[SDL_image 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)**: Allows SDL to load not only BMP's but also JPG's and PNG's.
- **[physfs](https://icculus.org/physfs/)**: Allows SDL to load content from within zip file containers.

## Setup Source code

### Windows (Visual Studio)

1. Download KITT Source code
2. Download SDL 2.0 Development libraries (VC) from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
3. Download SDL_Image 2.0 Development libraries (VC) from [here](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/).
4. Download physfs source code from [here](https://icculus.org/physfs/downloads/).

**TODO**

### MAC OS X
